    <h2>About Butter chicken</h2>
    <img src="butter-chicken.jpg" alt="butter chicken image">
    <p>Butter Chicken also known as Chicken Makhani is a classic Indian dish that’s made by simmering marinated & grilled chicken (Tandoori chicken) in a spicy, aromatic, buttery and creamy tomato gravy. This lip-smacking and delicious dish is hugely popular among the Indian food lovers across the world.</p>

    <p>It is believed that Butter Chicken was invented during 1930 to 1935, by Kundan Lal Jaggi & Kundan Lal Gujral, the owners/partners of a restaurant named Moti Mahal in Delhi, India. The restaurant would usually have large orders of tandoori chicken but sometimes ended up with leftovers which were dry.</p>

    <p>Butter Chicken was a way to use up the leftover dry Tandoori Chicken. The large pieces of grilled chicken were diced and simmered in a rich creamy and buttery tomato gravy. That’s how Murgh Makhani – Chicken Makhani came into existence.</p>
